The program runs with command line arguments. First the location of the rules
and then the unsolved sudoku in the format on canvas ('..34...23..etc.'). An example of a sudoku that the algorithm is able to solve is 
"5..6.7.4..4.5...3.2...4....1..4..9.2...2..3.5..6...4....2...1.6.3.1.2........6...".
If the last three is removed the solver cant find a solution anymore, like so:
"5..6.7.4..4.5...3.2...4....1..4..9.2...2..3.5..6...4....2...1.6...1.2........6...".
