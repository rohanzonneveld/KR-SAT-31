The SAT.py contains three version of the DPLL algorithm.
-S1: basic DPLL with random choice of next literal
-S2: adapted DPLL with human strategy based number strategy heuristic
-S3: adapted DPLL with human strategy based cell strategy heuristic

To test the algorithm which switches between -S2 and -S3 set p=0.2 in line 211 of
SAT.py and run program with command line arguments as usual. Algorithm will start
with chosen heuristic and will switch to the other human based strategy with 
probability p. Note that the algorithm will not switch if the basic DPLL is
chosen (-S1).

To recreate the data obtained for the paper run loop.py with all different algorithms.
